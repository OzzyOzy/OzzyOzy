# üëã Hi, I'm Oscar Cerna [Ozzy]

## „äóÔ∏è About Me 
<p>
I am a full-stack .NET developer with experience building multi-tiered web applications. I received my undergrad degree from The Art Institute of Atlanta. After working in the legal field for several years, I decided to shift my career to technology. I've been interested in coding and software development for some time since taking some information technology classes back in high school, and I have really enjoyed immersing myself in the field. I hope to become a senior developer in a few years to mentor others, possibly including others trying to make career shifts as I have.

Since deciding to shift careers, I have developed applications using both Node.js and C# in a .NET environment. During my time at Revature, I have worked on several projects which expanded my skill set with both backend (including .NET, ASP.NET, Entity Framework, SQL, and SOA) and frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, Typescript, and Angular). I've gained experience deploying my applications to the cloud making use of CI/CD tools, primarily Azure DevOps pushed to the Azure cloud. I am eager and excited to apply all of my skills and prior experience in a position on your team.
